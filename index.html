<section id="history">
    <h2>The Legacy: Over a Century of Success</h2>
    <p>The Yael family's rise to prominence began in 1890, when their patriarch, Elias Yael, a visionary entrepreneur, founded what would become a multi-generational empire. Elias, a skilled businessman with a deep understanding of the African market, made his fortune in mining, which formed the foundation for the family's wealth. His ability to navigate the complexities of the early African economic landscape and make strategic investments set the stage for the family's success for generations to come.</p>
    
    <p>By the early 20th century, the Yaels had expanded their interests into various industries, including agriculture, real estate, and eventually energy. Under the leadership of Elias' sons, the Yael family diversified their wealth into numerous international markets, particularly focusing on Africa and the emerging economies of South America. Throughout the years, the Yaels have used their resources to fund both business ventures and philanthropic projects aimed at improving the lives of those in the communities where they operate.</p>

    <p>The family’s commitment to education and empowerment, especially for women and children, became a cornerstone of their philanthropic endeavors. By the mid-20th century, the Yaels had built schools, hospitals, and orphanages in some of the most underserved areas of Africa, earning them recognition as leaders in social impact alongside their business prowess.</p>

    <p>Today, the Yael family is one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the world. With assets spanning multiple continents, they have become a beacon for corporate responsibility, sustainable business practices, and philanthropic contributions to global issues. Despite their vast wealth, the Yaels maintain a level of privacy and modesty, often avoiding public displays of affluence and preferring to quietly work behind the scenes to make a difference.</p>

    <p>The family's legacy continues to thrive under the leadership of the younger generation, who are combining the lessons of their forefathers with a modern approach to business, technology, and global sustainability. The Yael family’s commitment to social causes, education, and renewable energy makes them a leading force in shaping a better world for future generations.</p>
